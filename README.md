# community_detection CS511 project repository.

Code for generating graph data is committed. Please look at community_detection/single_label_triangle_motif_example.py and follow the comments there. 
I have run this script and generated csv data which can be loaded into neo4j(examples/vertices.csv and examples/edges.csv). You can change parameters in the script and generate your own data. You don't have to commit csv files again and again.
